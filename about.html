    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>The Grey Horse has stood at the heart of the village for over three centuries.  
    Originally a 17th-century coaching inn, it welcomed travellers, traders, and locals seeking warmth, good ale, and a friendly fire.</p>

    <p>Much of that original character remains. The old beams overhead have watched countless stories unfold; the hearth has been a gathering point for generations; and the spirit of the inn has always been one of comfort, community, and belonging.</p>

    <h2>Today</h2>
    <p>While the centuries have passed, our purpose hasn’t changed.  
    We continue to serve honest food, well-kept ale, and a welcoming atmosphere for everyone who walks through our door.</p>

    <p>Whether you’re joining us for a quiet drink, a hearty meal, or one of our village events, you’ll find the same warmth and charm that has defined The Grey Horse since the 1600s.</p>
